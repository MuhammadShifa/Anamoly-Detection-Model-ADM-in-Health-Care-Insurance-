# Horovod-with-Keras
Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet. The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use.
The primary motivation for the Horovod project is to make it easy to take a single-GPU training script and successfully scale it to train across many GPUs in parallel.
